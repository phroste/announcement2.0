	<h2>About the show</h2>

	<p>Legion, based on the Marvel Comics by Chris Claremont and Bill Sienkiewicz, is the story of David Haller (played by Dan Stevens) - a troubled young man who may be more than human.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Diagnosed as schizophrenic as a child, David has been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for years. Now in his early 30s and institutionalized once again, David loses himself in the rhythm of the structured regimen of life in the hospital.</p>
	<br>
	<p>David's life is completely upended with the arrival of a beautiful and troubled new patient named Syd (played by Rachel Keller). Inexplicably drawn to one another, David and Syd share a startling encounter: the voices David hears and the visions he sees are the result of him being a mutant.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Noah Hawley serves as Executive Producer, along with Lauren Shuler Donner, Bryan Singer, Simon Kinberg, Jeph Loeb, Jim Chory, and John Cameron. Legion is the latest project from Hawley and Cameron, two of the executive producers of the Emmy and Golden Globe-winning FX anthology series Fargo.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Legion is produced by FX Productions and Marvel Television.</p>
